    And the following languages are available:

    And I enter "Teaser text" in the "Teaser" wysiwyg editor
    And I enter "Body text" in the "Body text" wysiwyg editor
    And I fill in "Subject tags" with "financing"
    And I fill in "Content owner" with "Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development"
    And I press "Save"
    Then I should see "News 1"
    # Create a second node.
    When I visit "the News creation page"

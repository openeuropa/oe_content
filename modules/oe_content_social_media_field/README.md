# OpenEuropa Social Media Field

This module provides the Social media field type, as well as a default widget and formatter.
It provides a basic twig template for rendering, but it is meant to be overridden by the OpenEuropa Theme which provides
the Europa Component Library (ECL) timeline component.

The field has the following properties:
* Type: The type of the link, in this case social media like "Twitter, Facebook"
* URL: The url of the social media link.
* Title: title of the social media link.

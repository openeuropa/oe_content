Allows to reference organisations in very specific cases, such as a contact information.

This module provides the following bundles:

- Organisation contact bundle, to reference Organisation content types

In order for users to view, edit or delete contacts you need to explicitly grant them the right permissions.

The module provides the following permissions:

- `Contact: Create new Organisation entity`
- `Contact: Delete any Organisation entity`
- `Contact: Edit any Organisation entity`

Grant the `Contact: View any published entity` permissions to the anonymous user role in order to allow your
site's visitors to view contact entities.

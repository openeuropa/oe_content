# Corporate Contact entity type

The Contact entity type is used when collecting information about different types of contacts,
such as a press contact.

This module provides the following bundles:

- General contact bundle, useful to collect generic contact information
- Press contact bundle, useful to collect press related information

In order for users to view, edit or delete contacts you need to explicitly grant them the right permissions.

The module provides the following permissions:

- `Contact: Access canonical page`
- `Contact: Access overview page`
- `Contact: Create new General entity`
- `Contact: Create new Press entity`
- `Contact: Delete any General entity`
- `Contact: Delete any Press entity`
- `Contact: Edit any General entity`
- `Contact: Edit any Press entity`
- `Contact: View any published entity`
- `Contact: View any unpublished entity`

Grant the `Contact: View any published entity` permissions to the anonymous user role in order to allow your
site's visitors to view contact entities.
